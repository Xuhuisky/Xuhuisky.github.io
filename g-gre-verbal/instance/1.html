                        Kleptoplasty (from the Greek κλέπτης, kleptes, meaning “thief”) is a phenomenon whereby host organisms ingest a chlorophyll-utilizing species, typically algae, and use the energy-producing organelles called chloroplasts contained within the consumed species to help meet their own metabolic needs. In this way, kleptoplasty is an example of symbiosis, a close relationship between two different species. Further, it is an endosymbiosis, such that one of the species resides completely within another. Unlike the example of mitochondria, thought to have once been fully separate bacteria that came to live within animal cells and perform a mutualistic metabolic function, the algae are only partially utilized; most of the organism is digested and discarded, leaving only the chloroplasts to be retained by the host. Most kleptoplastic species are unicellular ciliates or dinoflagellates. The only known members of the animal kingdom that practice kleptoplasty are several species of sarcoglossan sea slugs. These “solar-powered” sea slugs incorporate whole chloroplasts into their body cells, where the stolen plastids can convert sunlight into useful energy for as long as ten months in some species.<br>Chloroplasts produce energy by using sunlight to power a series of reactions that result in sugars that can be used as a food source for the host organism. Algae have genes that encode proteins that act as enzymes that support this process. PRK, for example, is an enzyme that is responsible for the regeneration of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate, an organic molecule used in the reductive pentose phosphate pathway (RPPP) of photosynthesis. Sea slugs lack the PRK gene, so for many kleptoplastic species, once the raw materials within the chloroplasts are exhausted, photosynthesis ceases and new chloroplasts must be obtained. As a result, until recently it remained a mystery how some sarcoglossan sea slug species were able to sustain chloroplast function for many months.<br>Genome sequencing revealed the answer. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of the genome of individual sarcoglossan sea slugs of species Elysia chlorotica that had been exposed to chlorophyll-utilizing algae revealed that these individuals did in fact have the PRK gene, whereas individuals that had not been exposed to algae lacked the gene. Radioactive labeling confirmed the surprising result: E. chlorotica incorporates genes from the algae into its own genome. This process, known as horizontal gene transfer, is common in bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes but is rare to find in more complex species. <br>
